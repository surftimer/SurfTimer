This is an open source timer plugin made for CS:GO.

[SurfTimer Discord](https://discord.surftimer.dev)

SurfTimer Test Servers:
 - North America: `connect na-test-server.surftimer.dev`
 - Europe: `connect eu-test-server.surftimer.dev:27045`

## Project Goals

Since the vast majority of CS:GO surf communties use this plugin, our main goal with the project has been to fix the major bugs/issues that exist. Since we now believe the vast majority to be fixed, we have now started looking into adding some new features! 

We encourage everyone who uses this plugin to also share their bug related fixes. If so, we can all work towards having a bug free, feature rich timer plugin.

Less bugs = better experience = more players for surf!

## Point System
<details>
  <summary>Explanation</summary>

The points system has seen a massive overhaul from the original ckSurf; it is now a percentile tiered system. Points are now distributed in two ways: (1) map completion, and (2) map ranking. Map completion points will be given to all players who complete a specific and are dependent on the tier.
* Tier 1: 25
* Tier 2: 50
* Tier 3: 100
* Tier 4: 200
* Tier 5: 400
* Tier 6: 600
* Tier 7: 800
* Tier 8: 1000

Map ranking points are dependent upon the individuals ranking on the map. This is done firstly by calculation of the WR points for the map. WR points per tier are calculated as follows:
* Tier 1: WR = MAX(250, (58.5 + (1.75 * Number of Completes) / 6))
* Tier 2: WR = MAX(500, (82.15 + (2.8 * Number of Completes) / 5))
* Tier 3: WR = MAX(750, (117 + (3.5 * Number of Completes) / 4))
* Tier 4: WR = MAX(1000, (164.25 + (5.74 * Number of Completes) / 4))
* Tier 5: WR = MAX(1250, (234 + (7 * Number of Completes) / 4))
* Tier 6: WR = MAX(1500, (328 + (14 * Number of Completes) / 4))
* Tier 7: WR = MAX(1750, (420 + (21 * Number of Completes) / 4))
* Tier 8: WR = MAX(2000, (560 + (30 * Number of Completes) / 4))

Once the WR points are calculated the top 10 are points are calculated by multiplying the WR points by a factor. These factors are:
* Rank 2 = WR * 0.8
* Rank 3 = WR * 0.75
* Rank 4 = WR * 0.7
* Rank 5 = WR * 0.65
* Rank 6 = WR * 0.6
* Rank 7 = WR * 0.55
* Rank 8 = WR * 0.5
* Rank 9 = WR * 0.45
* Rank 10 = WR * 0.4

Players who are not in the top 10 but are above the 50th percentile in map ranking will be sorted into 5 groups – with each higher group giving proportionally more points. These groups and their point distribution are as follows:
* Group 1 (top 3.125%) = WR * 0.25
* Group 2 (top 6.25%) = (Group 1) / 1.5
* Group 3 (top 12.5%) = (Group 2) / 1.5
* Group 4 (top 25%) = (Group 3) / 1.5
* Group 5 (top 50%) = (Group 4) / 1.5
